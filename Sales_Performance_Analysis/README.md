# Product Sales Analysis

## Project Description

This project analyzes product sales data from November and December to identify trends in revenue, sales volume, product performance, and regional and salesperson contributions. It includes a breakdown of monthly performance, highlights key insights, and visualizes data to support better business understanding.
