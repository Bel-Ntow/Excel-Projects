#  CreativePulse Media –Digital Campaign Analysis

##  Project Description  
This project analyzes client performance and retention patterns at **CreativePulse Media**, a digital advertising agency based in Abuja. The company has been experiencing increasing client inactivity, including contract pauses and cancellations.



##  Project Objective  
The goal of this project is to identify client churn patterns, analyze campaign performance metrics, and provide actionable recommendations to improve client retention and communication of ROI.



##  Key Insights

1. **Client Status Overview**  
   - Out of 100 clients: **66 are active**, **18 paused**, **9 expired**, and **7 canceled**.  
   - This means **34% of clients are currently inactive**, indicating a significant churn risk.

2. **Industry-Based Churn Patterns**  
   - All clients in the **Energy & Utilities** industry canceled their contracts.  
   - All **Construction** and **Automotive** clients paused their contracts.  
   - In contrast, industries like **Healthcare**, **Agriculture**, and **Food & Beverage** had 100% active clients.  
   - This suggests a strong link between **client status and industry**, with some industries consistently retaining clients and others showing clear churn trends.

3. **Correlation Between Ad Spend and Performance**  
   - Clients who spent more on ads generally had **better conversion rates and more leads**.
   - Using Excel's `CORREL` function, the correlation between **ad spend and lead conversion** was **0.87**, indicating a **strong positive relationship**.
   - **Canceled clients** had the **highest average ad spend** and also recorded the **highest performance metrics**.
   - **Paused clients** followed in both ad investment and performance, then **active clients**, while **expired clients** had the **lowest spend and weakest performance**.
   - This suggests that while **higher ad spend tends to lead to better performance**, it does not always guarantee client retention — highlighting the need for better communication of value and expectations.



##  Recommendations

- **Establish onboarding performance benchmarks** using historical averages (e.g., 3.7% conversion rate, GHS 44 cost per lead) to help clients set realistic expectations based on industry and ad spend.
- **Implement clear ROI communication for all clients**, ensuring every client understands campaign results in the context of their goals and spend.
- **Develop industry-specific retention strategies**, especially for high-risk sectors like Energy & Utilities, Construction, and Automotive.
- **Create a re-engagement workflow** for paused and expired clients with previously strong performance — these clients may be recoverable with the right follow-up.
