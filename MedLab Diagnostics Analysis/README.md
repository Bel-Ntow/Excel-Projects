# MedLab Diagnostics Analysis 
In this project, I analyzed diagnostic test data for a biomedical facility to uncover insights into test demand, patient retention, and lab operational efficiency.

## Project Objective
The goal was to use data to identify popular and underutilized services, evaluate patient return patterns, and optimize peak and off-peak hours to improve workflow and revenue stability


## Key Insights

### 1. **Test Demand**
**Malaria, Liver function, Pregnancy, Cholesterol, and Full blood count tests** were the most frequently requested across the four-month period.
By contrast, **COVID-19 test** was significantly underutilized, likely due to reduced public awareness and perceived urgency in 2024, compared to the pandemic peak years.

### 2. **Patient Retention Patterns**
The patient return rate was **49.7%**, meaning just under half of patients came back for repeat visits.  
Returning patients frequently underwent **Pregnancy, ECG, Thyroid panel, Hepatitis B, Sickle cell, Lipid profile, CRP, and Vitamin D tests**.  
This trend suggests recurring or chronic diagnostic needs, indicating potential for follow-up programs, loyalty offers, or educational outreach to encourage continuous care.

### 3. **Referral Source Performance**
- **Hospital C** and **Private Clinic B** were the most successful in referring patients who returned for follow-up tests.  
- **Walk-ins** and **Online Bookings** had lower retention, while **Hospital A** and **Private Clinic D** mainly contributed one-time patients.  
This highlights the need to strengthen digital and direct outreach for lower-performing channels and reinforce successful partnerships.

### 4. **Peak vs. Off-Peak Scheduling**
**52.3%** of diagnostic activity occurred during peak hours. The workload was particularly high in January and March.  
Off-peak hours remain underutilized, creating an opportunity to offer off-peak discounts, implement scheduling incentives and better distribute resources to reduce congestion during peak times

### 5. **Operational Turnaround Time**
The average turnaround for test results was **4 hours and 22 minutes**. While efficient overall, peak hours may slow result delivery.  
Monitor turnaround during high-volume periods and optimize workflow to maintain consistency.
